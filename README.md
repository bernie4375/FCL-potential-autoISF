     The current default branch "FCL-book-autoISF" (in pdf) is for autoISF 3.0

     This branch is an update prepared for the soon-to-be launched autoISF 3.0.1

      Sections 03 and 11 are not launch-ready quite yet
      The case studies mostly sit in the current default

     (Feature differences to 3.0 are minor, see section 12)
     (This new set of pdfs contains lots of general improvements; some reflect 
     user experience shared in Discord)
