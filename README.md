     The current default branch is still  "FCL-book-autoISF" (in pdf; for autoISF 3.0).

     Feature differences to 3.0 are minor (see section 12), so
     it is probably a good idea to use THIS branch, that will soon turn into default, now:
     
     This new set of pdfs contains lots of general improvements, 
     reflecting some user experience (Discord) 
     
     Sorry, any hopes for easier readability must be disappointed,
     notably as including "everything" about the emulator now, too.
