Note 1: YOU are responsible to periodically read the English pdf original for eventual changes made: Important ones might need to be carried into your version, too

Note 2: Apologies that the word or ppt versions can be quite a patchwork of insertions and quick fixes (like putting an invisible white box over something to disappear, and other little fun surprises... - The main author just is no pro at formatting, and enjoys any quick DIY fix to get to the desired pdf)
