     
     This is a repository of documents (aka "FCL e-book") that supports setting up 
     a no-bolus no carb-inputs Full Closed Loop (FCL). 
     
While easy-to-use once it is properly set up, please observe that 
     * certain pre-requisites must be given, and 
     * the suggested sequence for the initial tuning of your system should be followed.
     
     
Focus is on AAPS-based autoISF (v. 3.0.1 and higher), 
but other methods are discussed and referenced, as well. 
     
To access the pdf files, you may need to go to "<> code" on very top left side of this page  autoISF 3.0.1

      
Disclaimer – Important to read and understand:

Authors are no medical professionals but T1 diabetics (or parents of a T1D child) who report their -limited - understanding and experience, in an effort to contribute to a growing body of knowledge, and to facilitate development of patient centered solutions. 
Nothing in this site is medical advice, but meant to stimulate patient-driven self-responsible re-search, and is meant also to stimulate product developments by the medical industry. Anything you try to conclude for yourself you do on own risk. This is by no means a medical product but what is offered is a toolset for participating in development. 
Never copy what others report to use, but investigate and adjust to your data. Neglecting safety instructions, and just using the “buttons” that are made available in a supposed “learning by doing” mode, would be very dangerous with the early development stage tools this research paper is about. 
In case you choose to get deeper involved, run the system disconnected, parallel to your current glucose management, to learn its behavior before eventually considering (on own risk) to go any further. Please stay connected and share experiences, too.
