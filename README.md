*This is the (outdated) "FCL e-book") that went with autoISF 3.0

 
**Nothing in this site is medical advice, but it is meant to stimulate patient-driven self-responsible re-search**, *and also to stimulate product developments by the medical industry. Anything you try to conclude for yourself, you do on own risk. This is by no means a medical product but what is offered is a toolset for participating in development. 
Never copy what others report to use, but investigate and adjust to your data. Neglecting safety instructions, and just using the “buttons” that are made available in a supposed “learning by doing” mode, would be very dangerous with the early development stage tools this research paper is about. 
In case you choose to get deeper involved, run the system disconnected, parallel to your current glucose management, to learn its behavior before eventually considering (on own risk) to go any further. Please stay connected and share experiences, too.*
