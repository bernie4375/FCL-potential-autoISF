     The current default branch "FCL-book-autoISF" (in pdf) is for autoISF 3.0

     This branch is an update prepared for the soon-to-be launched autoISF 3.0.1 
     
     (Feature differences to 3.0 are minor, see section 12)
     (This new set of pdfs contains lots of general improvements; some reflect 
     user experience shared in Discord)
